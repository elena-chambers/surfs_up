- Mean temp in June is 75°F, and december mean temp is 4 degrees cooler at 71°F
- Mean precipitation in june is 0.14 inches, while december precipitation is slighter higher at 0.22 in.
- there is a slighty larger standard deviation in temperture in december, suggesting higher variablitly in temperture day by day in december. 

## Summary
Weather trends in Hawaii are fairly stable year-long. Changes in average temps and average precipiation between June and December are nearly negligible. This would suggest that this location would be profitable all year as a surf shop!
